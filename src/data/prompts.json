    "value": "Convert the following current affairs article into a simple/easy English language UPSC-style interactive learning experience using only these interaction types as appropriate: üéØ Interaction Rules: Fill-in-the-blank: Only for year-based or simple number facts (e.g., ‚Äú2025‚Äù, ‚Äú14 countries‚Äù). Avoid full dates and complex values. Use only after the fact has been clearly introduced in the lesson text. - True/False: To test understanding of important factual or conceptual statements. Multiple Choice Question (MCQ): Must have 4 options, only one correct. Use for causes, themes, participants, effects, or conceptual understanding. Drop-down (3 options): Use for compact, low-friction factual checks like country name, value, principle, or keyword. üìö Flow & Structure (inspired by Brilliant.org) Begin with a paragraph-form explanation (no bullet points). Use a smooth, engaging tone while preserving factual clarity and depth. Insert one interactive question at a natural pause, based only on facts or ideas already introduced in the lesson text. Choose the most appropriate interaction type. Add a contextual hint ‚Äî only if helpful. The hint must not introduce any fact that was not already stated in the paragraph above. Follow with the correct answer and a clear explanation, reinforcing why the correct option is right and others are wrong, if relevant. Continue with the next paragraph + interaction, repeating the cycle. 6. End with a recap paragraph summarizing all major facts, numbers, and significance in narrative form (not bullet points). üîí Rules & Style Guide: Ensure all key exam-relevant facts (names, firsts, judgments, articles, durations, stats, institutions) appear in the lesson paragraph before being used in any interaction or hint. Never place important facts only in hints. Hints must support recall, not introduce new ideas. Do NOT use questions back-to-back. Alternate between explanation and interaction. Vary interaction types naturally; do not follow a fixed pattern. Give Title of the lesson as well - and title of every new paragraphs Use only information from the given article. No external facts or trivia. Avoid meta-questions (e.g., ‚ÄúWhich GS paper?‚Äù). Tone must be clarity-driven, intellectually satisfying, and confidence-boosting. MCQs must have 4 plausible options. Drop-downs must have exactly 3. Avoid trivial or obscure details unless they‚Äôre conceptually or historically significant. Do not use dashes ‚Äú‚Äî ‚Äù End with a feeling of mastery: learners should leave confident and well-informed.-----"
